# medium-style-comments

### Checklist
- [ ] Build a [medium.com](https://medium.com) style commenting / notes system in React (here is a similar demo in JQuery: http://aroc.github.io/side-comments-demo/#demo)
- [ ] Make it work for a single user and a static text (no signup / login needed)
- [ ] People can mark text and attach a comment to it
- [ ] **try your best to make it look good (e.g. styling and transitions)**
- [ ] store comments in localStorage like a DB

### Summarised
* Single user (e.g. Hello my name is ____), single wall of static text
* `<mark>` (highlight) text and attach comments
* Load and save to localStorage
* Deploy to static bundle hoster (or rails on heroku if time allows)
